# Pong

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game features two paddles, a ball, and a scoring system. Players control their paddles using the keyboard, and the game includes a basic pause functionality. The game also keeps track of high scores and displays them, using file handling.

## Features


- **Two-player mode**: Play against a friend using two paddles.
- **Pause functionality**: Pause the game and resume at any time.
- **Scoring system**: Tracks and displays scores for both players.
- **High score tracking**: Saves and displays high scores.

## Controls

- **W/S**: Move the left paddle up and down.
- **Up/Down Arrow Keys**: Move the right paddle up and down.
- **P**: Pause/Resume the game.
